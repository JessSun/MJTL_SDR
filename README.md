# MJTL_SDR:An open-source MATLAB software-defined receiver for multi-frequency GNSS joint Tracking

The software-defined receiver implements two approaches: Doppler-aided and Kalman filter-based multi-frequency joint tracking, while integrating the single-frequency independent tracking module as baseline. The software is designed to provide researchers with an experimental framework for systematic comparisons between multi-frequency joint tracking and standard single-frequency tracking method under unified data and configuration conditions, facilitating mechanism research and performance evaluation of multi-frequency tracking across diverse scenarios.
